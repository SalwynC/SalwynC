### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm in my final year studying computer science in India. Honestly, it's been a balancing act—trying to stay on top of coursework while spending most of my time building stuff that actually works and ships. Right now, I'm **actively hunting for internships or full-time roles** where I can write real code and learn from people who know way more than I do.

💡 Currently working on **ethishop** - an e-commerce platform analyzing products for sustainability  
🌱 Learning backend optimization, deployment, and proper DevOps practices  
💬 Ask me about React, Node.js, MongoDB, or anything web dev  
⚡ Fun fact: I rely heavily on Stack Overflow and debugging at 2 AM  
📧 Reach me: **Open to opportunities!**

## 💡 What I'm Working On

Most of my time right now goes into **ethishop**—it's this e-commerce platform I'm building that scores products based on how sustainable and ethical they are. Think "Is this brand treating workers fairly? Is the supply chain transparent?" kind of stuff.

It started as an idea, and now it's turning into a real full-stack project where I'm dealing with backend stuff I never touched in class—like optimizing MongoDB queries so the app doesn't crawl, handling user auth properly, and figuring out deployment without breaking everything.

I've also built a few other things along the way: a chat app, some automation scripts, and random utilities that seemed useful at the time. Some of them actually work pretty well.
