# Hey, I'm Salwyn 👋

I'm in my final year studying computer science in India. Honestly, it's been a balancing act—trying to stay on top of coursework while spending most of my time building stuff that actually works and ships. Right now, I'm actively hunting for internships or full-time roles where I can write real code and learn from people who know way more than I do.

## My GitHub Contributions as a Game of Life

This cool visualization takes my GitHub contribution graph and runs it through Conway's Game of Life—a cellular automaton that's basically just cells living, dying, and evolving based on simple rules. It's nerdy, but I think it's a fun way to see your GitHub activity come alive.

## What I'm Working On

Most of my time right now goes into **ethishop**—it's this e-commerce platform I'm building that scores products based on how sustainable and ethical they are. Think "Is this brand treating workers fairly? Is the supply chain transparent?" kind of stuff.

It started as an idea, and now it's turning into a real full-stack project where I'm dealing with backend stuff I never touched in class—like optimizing MongoDB queries so the app doesn't crawl, handling user auth properly, and figuring out deployment without breaking everything.

I've also built a few other things along the way: a chat app, some automation scripts, and random utilities that seemed useful at the time. Some of them actually work pretty well.

## Tech I Use

Here's what I'm comfortable with (and what I use almost every day):

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind—basically building UIs that don't make people want to leave immediately
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express for APIs, handling routes, middleware, all that jazz
- **Database:** MongoDB—learning schema design the hard way, setting up indexes, dealing with authentication
- **Deployment:** I usually deploy frontend stuff on Vercel. Still wrapping my head around Docker and proper DevOps, but getting there.
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git (obviously), Postman for testing APIs, and honestly, a lot of Stack Overflow and documentation reading

I've also been messing around with Python lately—mostly for web scraping and automation when I need something quick and dirty.
